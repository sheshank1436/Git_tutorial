Git has 3 stage architecture:
-working directory-->staging area-->repository

.git:
.git stores all the information about the version control
pwd:
pwd is used to know the present working directory

ls:
ls is used to list the contents of the directory

git status:
git status is used to check the status of the present directory whether the present directory is a repo or not.

git init:
 it is used to initialize the present directory as the git repo.

git add:
 git add is used for two purposes:
  git add --a is used to add the untracked files or newly added files into the staging area.
  git add filename is used to turn a modified file to unmodified version in other words this command will help the modified file 
  to send the changes init to staging area.
git commit:
 Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.
 The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots 
 can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
 git commit -m "message" is used to commit with a message.

git log:
 git log is used to see all the history of commits which we did.

how to delete the present folder as a repo?
 rm -f .git will remove the present directory as a repo and the folder will not be tracked anymore.

git clone:
git clone "link" is used to get all the contents from link and will be downloaded into the present folder.

.gitignore:
 suppose you have some files in the folder which shouldn't be tracked but git then that file name should be .gitignore file in the folder.
 we can create .gitignore in the present directory by using touch .gitignore
 suppose you have file name  error.log which shouldn't be tracked add error.log to the .gitignore file and that file wont be tracked
 suppose you have a directory with name dir which shouldn't be tracked add dir/ to the .gitignore file and that folder wont be tracked.
 suppose in  dir you only want dir to be untracked and you want its sub dir to be tracked then use \dir\  to the .gitignore file and that folder wont be tracked
