Git has 3 stage architecture:
-working directory-->staging area-->repository

.git:
.git stores all the information about the version control
pwd:
pwd is used to know the present working directory

ls:
ls is used to list the contents of the directory

git status:
git status is used to check the status of the present directory whether the present directory is a repo or not.

git init:
 it is used to initialize the present directory as the git repo.

git add:
 git add is used for two purposes:
  git add --a is used to add the untracked files or newly added files into the staging area.
  git add filename is used to turn a modified file to unmodified version in other words this command will help the modified file 
  to send the changes init to staging area.
git commit:
 Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.
 The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots 
 can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
 git commit -m "message" is used to commit with a message.

git log:
 git log is used to see all the history of commits which we did.

how to delete the present folder as a repo?
 rm -f .git will remove the present directory as a repo and the folder will not be tracked anymore.

git clone:
git clone "link" is used to get all the contents from link and will be downloaded into the present folder.
